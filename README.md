# MachineLearning-DeepLearning
This GitHub repository contains the code implementation for my Master's Thesis

It focus on the study of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning models applied to classification problems. 
The project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis, both theoretically and practically, of different algorithms and techniques in the field. 
The implemented codes demonstrate the effectiveness and performance of these approaches, comparing their advantages and disadvantages in terms of accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.

This repository includes Matlab scripts for implementation of algorithms as basic SVM, soft Margin SVM, PSVM and CPSVM.
